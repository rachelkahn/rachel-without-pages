		Once you've linked your desired image to your index.html file, create a div for that image and name it "image container."</h3>
	<h3>
		Within the div, size the image, such as 50px X 100px (this will be the original size of the image.) Within your styles.css file, create a tab named .imagecontainer and start playing around with the hover effect!</h3>
	<h3>
		To create the effect, within your .imagecontainer, you will have to add >image:hover within the tab, which will signal the effect. To make the hover change your images size, you will then add in the new size measurements, such as 500px X 800px.</h3>
	<h3>
		This will create an enlargment effect when the mouse hovers over the small image. Creating a moment for the reader to view the imagery without too many other elements taking precedence.</h3>
