	<h2>SEATING IN THE INTERNATIONAL POSTWAR ARENA</h2>
	<p> The technological progress achieved during the Second World War was of crucial importance to postwar furniture design. With the new materials and the new technology, Modernism's dream of mass-produceable quality furniture suited to the age could now for the first time be realised and benefit the majority of people.
    The industrial reconstruction and improvements of the 1950s brought about an economic upturn and an optimistic faith in the future, one consequence of which was the baby boom. There was an explosive increase in the numbers of families, resulting in a shortage of housing and a limit to the living area. This trend was seen immediately after the Second World War in the USA, the only country to retain its industrial production intact, and subsequently in Europe in tune with postwar reconstruction.
    In both Western continents, housing culture was introduced as a factor to raise the spirits, whereby furniture attracted fresh attention and achieved a new status.(FN2) Practical, space-saving storage cupboards became very much the fashion, taking up wall space and pushing tables and seating into the free space on the floor. In particular, designers turned their attention to the chair, its shape and its ergonomic comfort, gradually evolving chairs in which it was possible to sit in several ways and still sit correctly.
    The efforts of the 1950s to create quality furniture representing a functional improvement and simplification of the furnishings and fittings in the home were launched under labels such as "good design" and "good taste". As guarantees of quality, the designers' names were brought into the marketing process and efforts were often made to give the products a personal and domestic aura by means of associative designations and proper names -- an approach first seen in Italy.
    The expansion in mass communications brought about an increase in international exchange and competition. Design periodicals and furniture exhibitions enjoyed great popularity, and large numbers of international competitions were arranged, including some by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which sought to reflect the contemporary needs of the age.
    In the 1950s, it was particularly the USA, Italy and Scandinavia that stood out on the international design scene. The USA was in the forefront with industrial furniture, especially shell chairs made from laminated wood and upholstered fibre materials. The major furniture producers Knoll and Herman Miller marketed "Good design". Great Britain soon followed the American line. As a result of limited serial production, Italy stood out for its constant output of innovative chair designs which included both exclusive wooden furniture and chairs in the new materials that were emerging in the postwar era. Italy was alone in possessing a specialised plastics industry and thus became the driving force in the relaunching of plastics. In Scandinavia, the sense of quality and the profound understanding of the characteristics of wood deriving from the tradition of hand-crafted furniture by skilled cabinet makers was continued in a quieter version of Modernism that appealed especially to Germany and the USA and became known as "Scandinavian Modern". Denmark attracted attention in the international arena with hand-crafted furniture designed by Børge Mogensen, Hans. J. Wegner and Finn Juhl, and with Arne Jacobsen's industrial chair designs, which included designs in laminated wood and steel tubing. The "teak style" and "Danish Design" also demonstrated "good taste" and were examples of close collaboration between furniture designer and cabinet maker or furniture manufacturer.
    In the designs of the 1950s, early Modernism's demand for functionalism and simplicity is transformed partly into an organic and sculptural idiom inspired by nature, the special characteristics of the material, the sculpture of the day (e.g. Henry Moore and Jean Arp) or the aerodynamic forms in the field of transport -- to a certain extent dependent on whether the maker was working in natural or industrial materials.(FN3) -- In the USA Organic Modernism is also called "free flow". To some extent, the constructivist line in Modernism continued and was extended to include various rationalistic ramifications ranging from delicate sophistication to purism and anonymous standardisation.
    By the end of the 1950s, industrial trends were already revealing their less fortunate aspects in the form of a reduction in quality. The market was overflowing with standardised industrial furniture, plagiarised versions of designer furniture and fashionable products with deliberately built-in obsolescence. All of which was taking place while the cold war was being stepped up and the first manned space rocket was sent into orbit in 1961.
    Standardisation first concerned a narrow circle of intellectual members of the avant garde, one of whose objectives was to find futuristic alternatives to mass and popular culture, while others were beginning to look around in this culture and combine its components to produce a new style: Pop Art, which was started by the English "Independent Group" and the American avant-garde's breach with the philosophy of Modernism. At the beginning of the 60s they were joined by the post-war baby boomers, who had now grown into young men and women and wanted to free themselves from the conventions and "good taste" of their parent generation. Pop became the key word in fashion and music, denoting for a new, young life style.
    Pop culture was primarily a breach with social and moral values and was anti-rationalistic in attitude. It cultivated informality, mobility, feelings, an individual mixture of objects and visual effect: garish colours, wild patterns, crazy ideas, and lives lived according to the slogan of "enjoy it today and sling it tomorrow". In design, the 1960s became the decade of plastic, foam and modular furniture. Genuine Pop furniture, incarnating the philosophy of the age, was "knockdown" and "flat pack" furniture made of cardboard or inflatable plastic film. Seating broke with convention and tradition and developed into designs closer and closer to the floor, taking on shapes ranging from the entirely amorphous to the completely figurative. The intention was often anti-design.
    During the 60s, Pop culture blended into the field of space travel and science fiction, culminating in utopian projects for futuristic cities in the English Archigram group's idea of "the (space) capsule home", and in designers' space-travel-like total environments, and "soft environments".
    The trend towards Pop design started in Britain, swept through the entire West and to some extent Japan, but it was especially Italy and up to a point France that stood out internationally.
    In 1973 the first oil crisis broke and young people became older and concerned about the power of industry and the threat to the ecology, and as a result Pop culture ebbed out.</p>
